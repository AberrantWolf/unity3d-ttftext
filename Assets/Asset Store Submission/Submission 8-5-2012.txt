Description :

TTFText allows you to easily create real 3d text meshes inside the Unity Editor.
<br/><br/>

3D Text meshes may be produced from any vectorial fonts installed on your system. 
The mesh generation can be parameterized in many ways: extrusion, bevel, texture mappings, text justification, paragraph layouts.<br/>
Font texts may be emboldened, slanted, and simplified.
<br/><br/>

You may generate 3D texts either as a single mesh or create individual mesh for each character, word or line of a text. 
This permits to create fancy 3D text animations as well as to bypass the 65536 vertices per mesh limit with long texts.
By embedding fonts in your application, you will be allowed to dynamically create new 3d text during runtime on all platforms.
<br/><br/>

TTFText supports all major vectorial font formats such as TrueType, OpenType and Type 1. 
It has also successfully been tested with asiatic fonts.

Message To reviewer:

Hi,

Here is the updated new submission for TTFText in which
we think we have answered all your requests.

In particular, all demo scenes should now be
error free.

As for the font licence problem,
we removed any fonts from the package that
are covered by their own restrictive licence.
We kept just a few free fonts for demonstration purpose.
They are listed in the file "LICENSE fonts.txt".

We are not lawyer but we think that it won't conflict
with the Unity EULA licence as the font  licence (in most cases SIL Open font  Licence) specifically allows font
redistribution for any purpose with little to no restriction.

Thanks,
Best Regards,
Olivier Blanc
